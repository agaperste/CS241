1. Algorithm behind practice test 4. (b)?

2. Can we go over funcitonal programming again? eg. filter, map, reduce
creating an list containing either the number value or the boolean value.
map (lambda x: x^2, list)
if x = 1,2,3,4
then map = 1,4, 9, 16

def tempthreshold (n):
    return n> 70
tempinfeb = [30, 40, 50, 72, 30]
filter (tempthreshold, tempinfeb)
It would then return [72] because only 72 in the list has a False boolean value. 

mylist = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
def mysum (x, y):
    return x +y
reduce(mysum, mylist)

3. number 7, searching?

4. Hashing? 8?

5. standard for the size of a char...etc
